# Javascript Bomberman

* Game can be played online or offline (vs bots) both up to 4 players. But online doesnt support bots 


  * for online play server is needed which can be build in /server or just starting the binary in serverFiles
  (if multiplayer is not working, check console logs as low server port number may cause errors)



* gitwebRTC is a map from another project (which happens to be hosted here)
